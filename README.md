# Victorian Housing Data Integration and Transformation for Predictive Analysis

## Project Description

This project focuses on integrating and transforming diverse datasets related to housing in Victoria, Australia. The primary objective is to create a unified dataset by merging data from multiple sources such as XML, JSON, shapefiles, GTFS data, PDFs and web-scraped information. This unified dataset facilitates comprehensive data analysis, trend identification and machine learning applications in the real estate domain.

## Key Steps Involved

### Data Loading

Importing data from XML and JSON property files, shapefiles for suburb boundaries, GTFS public transport data, PDFs for LGA-to-suburb mappings, and web-scraped housing data.

### Data Integration

- **Property Data:** Merging XML and JSON property information into a single DataFrame, ensuring consistency and handling duplicates.
- **Geospatial Mapping:** Mapping properties to suburbs and LGAs using geographic coordinates through spatial joins.
- **Transport Accessibility:** Calculating distances to nearest train stations and estimating travel times to Melbourne Central using GTFS data.
- **Web Scraping:** Extracting additional housing data, such as median house prices, number of houses/units and demographics from `house.speakingsame.com`.

### Data Transformation

- **Data Cleaning:** Addressing missing values, correcting data types and standardising formats across the integrated dataset.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new variables such as travel time to Melbourne Central (`travel_min_to_MC`) and direct journey flags (`direct_journey_flag`).
- **Normalization and Scaling:** Applying data transformation techniques such as z-score standardisation, min-max scaling, and log transformations to prepare the dataset for modeling.

### Model Evaluation

Assessing the impact of different data transformation techniques on linear regression models, using performance metrics like Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and R-squared (R²).

Overall, this project highlights a robust approach to turning heterogeneous and unstructured data into a cohesive dataset suitable for downstream analysis, providing a strong foundation for real estate market analysis and urban planning efforts.

## Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Geospatial Analysis (GeoPandas, Shapely, Folium)
- Data Visualisation (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Web Scraping (Requests, BeautifulSoup)
- PDF Processing (PDFMiner)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/salmanjt/VIC-housing-data-pipeline.git
   cd VIC-housing-data-pipeline
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Data Sources

This project uses several publicly available datasets:

- Property data (XML, JSON) from project specifications
- Geographic boundaries (shapefiles) from Victorian Government Data Directory
- Public transport data (GTFS) from Public Transport Victoria
- Web-scraped housing statistics from `house.speakingsame.com`

## Future Improvements

- **Automated Testing:** Implement automated tests for data extraction and transformation processes to ensure robustness and reliability.
- **Advanced Modeling:** Explore advanced machine learning models, such as ensemble methods or neural networks, to enhance predictive performance.
- **Interactive Visualisation:** Integrate interactive visualisation to better understand spatial relationships and housing trends.
- **Data Updates:** Establish routines for regularly updating the dataset to reflect changes in property listings, transport schedules and housing market conditions.
